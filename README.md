Company Department Salary Calculation
 In this project I will create a recursive function to calculate the total salary expenditure for each department in a company. The company is divided into multiple departments, and each department has employees who might be organized in a hierarchy. Iâ€™ll use recursion to navigate through the employees in a department and calculate the total salary expenditure for that department.
